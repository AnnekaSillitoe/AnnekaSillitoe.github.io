    <h2>What next?</h2>
    <p>
      As I start to think about what I want to achieve in my career and what I'd
      be looking for in my next role, I start to truly understand where I want
      to see myself in the next 5 years. Whether that holds a traditional
      company role or not I'll ultimately unsure, but what I would like to
      personally achieve is becoming more and more clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would be looking for the opportunity to mentor and give back. Early in
      my career my values and beliefs were ultimately shaped by who I got to
      work with the messages that they passed on to me. Luckily I've been
      incredibly supported early into my career by fantastic senior developers
      who always told me to demand my worth and continue to push for the things
      I was most passionate about. Those things are accessibility and equality.
      They fall hand in hand with the user-experience and writing front end
      code. I want the opportunity to guide a junior through the turbulant time
      of a new career and help them to start a really fulfiling career in tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning. I love watching videos and trying out bits of code and
      digging around on MDN for answers. I love reading about W3C process and
      the CSS working groups changes and how the web continues to be improved by
      these areas of education and transforming the web for all. I have found
      fantastic male and female role models in areas of accessibilty, front end
      code, design, react, education and equality. And I feel very blessed to
      have an extensive list I can reach to when I want the answers to a
      question. But I want to join that list. I want to start teching and
      creating content for other developers to learn and reference. I want to be
      a positive female voice proving that women can achieve in tech. I'm not
      too sure what form this ambition currently takes or how quite to achieve
      that, but I know I want to feel supported by my next role to reach that
      goal somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a really very basic list of what I hope to find in my next role
      and things I think that ultimately I'd like to have to help me achieve my
