      So I genuinely thought coding was this complicated job that required a
      degree in computing and you needed to be a mastermind genius to understand
      stuff (aren’t we though?) But then my partner took up coding and was
      teaching himself around his day job and well, he doesn’t have a degree in
      computing so that myth went out the window. But he is pretty clever, so
      this is still a super mastermind genius job right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I started to write code myself. At the time I was still working as a
      freelance journalist and PR/marketing type and being grossly underpaid for
      the sheer hours and effort I was putting it. But the thing that really
      made me look to change careers was how much more fun writing code was
      compared to my day/night/all the time job. I realised I was no longer
      having fun for the amount of work I was doing and that I found I wanted to
      go home at night instead of to a gig to interview an artist and I wanted
      to sit and write a bunch of code and build another fun thing cause I could
      do that! (badly and slowly… but stuff was happening!)
    </p>
    <p>
      So I decided to take the plunge and change careers. I had started out
      learning HTML and CSS and JS through all the usual online
      haunts, Codecademy, Khan Academy (learning some more maths here too to
      play with css animation some) & freecodecamp. Once I had exhausted these
      resources, I paid for a CodeSchoolsubscription and started on there, doing
      the same things but in the most fun environment for learning I’ve still
      ever experienced in my career. (RIP CodeSchool! Those songs will stay with
      me forever!)
    </p>
    <p>
      But whilst moving through my learning, a local print shop wanted a new
      developer to start building their e-commerce site for them. It was
      templated already, it just needed someone with the knowledge (or some!) to
      go in and build out the pages for them. Hook their payment system up to
      SagePay and deliver the goods. I got the job. My first paid for freelance
      tech role (which looking back they paid criminally low for and no wonder
      they loved me!). But I didn’t care, I was being paid to spend my day
      working on a website that people would see and use.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was here I did my first pair programming, via a phone with a guy who
      worked at another branch of the print design store and he spoke about
      things I’d never heard of. Things my partner had knowledge of since his
      bootcamp and first role. The back end! This mysterious world that I was
      interacting with via his help… but without any knowledge of. I should
      learn this… I might like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I applied to a bootcamp. I had no money and no job at this time, other
      than the criminally low freelance work I was doing here and there. I
      couldn’t afford a big bootcamp, but I wanted to learn more. I was lucky. I
      got accepted onto a bootcamp and off I went for 16 weeks to learn
      everything from front end to back end, API’s to testing, frameworks and
      more. The very last week of that bootcamp I got introduced to React and I
      fell in love!
    </p>
    <p>
      I did a bit more freelance work for charities via the bootcamp, but I
      wanted to find a permanent role now. I wanted a solid wage, (I had been
      surviving on the reminants of my student loan that I had saved), and to
      learn more from people who had been doing this much longer than I. So I
      sort out my first role. I was the only female, the first female on the dev
      team. Little did I know this experience would play into my work choices
      years later. I didn’t care though, I was being paid to write code. But
      that code wasn’t React. That code was Angular 2 and I didn’t fall in love
      the same way. The songs on CodeSchool were amazing… the framework was
      fine… but it wasn’t like React. I continued to programme in React at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 6 month mark was rolling around on my first role and the company
      started to hit financial issues. Welcome to startup life! I would need to
      hunt for a new job. But that’s ok, I’d make sure this one was in React.
