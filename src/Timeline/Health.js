    <h2>Health and a new role</h2>
    <p>
      Just as I was changing roles or deciding on changing roles I got really
      sick. Sicker than I’d ever been before and along the long arduous journey
      to a diagnosis and treatment I discovered I had a heritable disorder of
      connective tissue. Which basically means I inherited some rubbish genes
      and my body wouldn’t ever quite be right again.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact it had never been right and I hadn’t ever truly noticed the signs.
      But it explained a lot to me. I used to like going to gigs and being out
      late, because I didn’t like mornings. I’m still not a morning person. My
      condition often stops me from achieving quality sleep (despite getting at
      least 8 hours a night), so I wake up tired and it’s a struggle to get
      ready and out the house to an office daily. But since getting sick I now
      have to eat a low carb diet… my body cannot cope with anything else. My
      autonomic nervous system doesn’t function right, carbs make everything bad
      - I get tremors and my ears ring constantly and my digestion gets really
      bad and as a result of all these things, I get weirdly anxious (it’s all
      to do with hormones and the nervous system and I could talk for hours on
      this… but this isn’t the place for that!). But along with now being
      classed as disabled, it had given me a new sense of purpose and knowledge
      and insight. One I had only ever seen glimpses of before, or one I just
      didn’t know about!
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s why I want to work remotely and why I want to work for a company that
      is remote first. You might not know your employees full situation and they
      shouldn’t have to disclose it to you just to get given the chance to have
      a nicer life, an easier life. Working from home makes me SO much more
      productive. I can sleep in 2 hours later, I can get breakfast and eat it
      whilst I start work checking my emails and getting prepared for the day. I
      can eat lunch because I didn’t have to stress about preparing to bring to
      the office my stupid dietary needs that aren’t easy to get from a
      supermarket or a local corner shop. These are just some of the reasons I
      want to work for a remote-first company personally, but everyone should be
      given that opportunity equally, because they might have reasons far
      different from mine and equally as justified, including just ‘I prefer
      it!’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, back to the story. I was lucky with my new company I had been
      hugely supported through all this and I eventually made a phased return to
      work (it’s an invisible illness. I am disabled… but I am still capable
      with the right support!), before eventually returning full time. I was now
      working at FutureLearn. I was a full stack developer working in React and
      Ruby and I was changing people’s lives through ‘transforming access to
      education’. The role provided training formally (something I’d never had
      before). The company were really good at pair programming, learning
      through others and it cared A LOT about accessibility. One of the main
      reasons I had taken the role. I wanted to give back, but teaching others
      now I’d got this far in to my career, mentoring. Whilst I would get to
      teach and share my knowledge through pair programming, sadly we have never
      hired juniors during my time at FutureLearn and I still await an
      opportunity to help guide others through the beginnings fo their career.
      But the team is 50% women (as of very recently) and it’s not a thing I
      want to compromise on again in future roles. I understand most company out
      there won’t have these numbers, but I want to hear what they’re doing to
      reach these numbers and how much of that percentage will be disabled,
      identify with a different gender other than ‘male’ or ‘female’, will not
      be white or heterosexual. I want to know that my future employers when
      they say they are committed to diversity, they mean it. They aren’t just
      ticking a box by hiring into one of those areas, but that they aim to be
      as diverse as possible and will build their products with the widest
      possible input. If you’re a tech bros company, why are you? What are you
      doing about fixing that and why should I be the only female on your team
      again? And how long until I’m not? It’s something I am incredibly
      passionate about. I’ve been very lucky to work for a company who has
      improved the gender balance of the tech team, but are still lacking other
      areas and will hold their hands up to that. It’s a fantastic place to work
      culturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few examples of things I’ve learned and achieved since being at
      FutureLearn:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pairing/mobbing - I had paired previously, but it’s pairing first here
        to share the knowledge and I have loved every single second of that as I
        am constantly learning from other fantastic developers of all levels. I
        also did my first ever mobbing here and I loved every single second of
        that too. It taught me some of the most important things I could take
        away with me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Atomic commits and telling the story through your commit history. Commit
        messages are LONG at FL. And every developer hates it when they first
        join and within a week they love it because you always know why a change
        was made in the code base by a person. You are given context and
        reasons, options and why this line of code exists. It’s all there for
        you and when you’re looking at something 5 years old, that’s HUGELY
        useful (especially if people have moved on since then)
      </li>
      <li>
        A/B testing - I’d never done this before. I’d always wanted to. I doubt
        I’ll use the platform we did ever again, but to understand statistical
        significance much more and why companies will want to A/B test has been
        educational
      </li>
      <li>
        TAX! - No seriously… I spent months learning about how tax works and how
        foreign tax can work and then how it needed to work for us and why and
        how.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working on a monolith means I’ve learned to appreciate life with SPA’s,
        RESTful APIs and micro services a lot more. They’re a luxury and I won’t
        ever take them for granted again.{" "}
      </li>
      <li>
        Testing - I did more TDD here than ever before and whilst I’m still not
        GREAT at it… I’m certainly better at it. I also understand why and how
        to better test everything more than I did before I started.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>So why leave? Why start looking? </p>
    <p>
      From a career perspective, the time has come to move on. There’s things I
      want to do that I can’t where I currently am. Things I want to achieve. I
      want to move back into the front end and really become a MASTER of the
      front end. I want to learn even more React, understand things better, test
      more and set up projects and explore tools in ways I’ve not done for a
      long time. With my new found knowledge, I think this could be an amazing
      time for my growth and my career. You can read more about what I’d be
      looking for on the what next page.
