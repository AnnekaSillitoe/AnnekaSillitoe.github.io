    <h3>My first job of choice</h3>
    <p>
      I’d say up until this point I jumped at the first opportunity I saw. I
      wasn’t sure I was in a position to be fussy. I needed work. I needed money
      to live and I was getting to write code. So I literally said yes to the
      first things offered to me. This time, whilst the pressure was on… I could
      be a bit more fussy. I understood how the tech world worked a little
      better and I knew whilst I couldn’t ask for the world, or rightfully
      demand it… I could look more towards sectors that interested me:
      TechForGood/NotForProfits, Science, Healthcare, Education.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first one where I ended up. A company doing social good across
      the world on a range of topics, with a tiny little tech team (5 of us once
      I joined - I was once again the only female) building digital products for
      local authorities mostly. I felt good with the work I was doing. I had a
      great team around me, albeit little. A product manager with a wealth of
      experience and enthusiasm. A data scientist who had started his career as
      a developer before getting the necessary degrees and one who was super
      inquisitive and engaging! A CTO with a great sense of humour and who was
      willing to pair and teach at a moment’s notice. And a senior front end who
      had seen it all, done it all and sat me down over a cocktail one evening
      and said, “always demand what you are worth! If we all do that, we all get
      paid better and more equally! It doesn’t matter that you’re a woman,
      you’re incredibly good at this”. I cherish that conversation even still.
      I’ve always tried to fight mine and others corner since, because he was
      right! I spent my time building in React… the latest version. Upgrading to
      the latest version when it was stable. I got to explore Redux and the
      newest versions as they were released. Testing with Jest and Enzyme. An
      introduction to tools like Prettier and Capybara. Browserstack, AWS. The
      list goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The team got bigger and changed over my time there, but despite its small
      nature we got the opportunity to explore tools and play around. It was
      really great! I got to learn accessibility and started to explore what
      this meant and how much of the web seemed to ignore this very important
      legal requirement. And I got to teach my peers about it and make sure they
      used it. But I was reaching the point in my career where I wanted to do
      more and sadly with such a small team this wasn’t going to provide me with
      the things I needed next.
    </p>
    <p> So I made the decision to leave.</p>
