      I am a patient advocate for those with Ehlers Danlos and it’s surrounding
      conditions (namely POTS and MCAS). I have heavily researched my conditions
      and consulted with specialist doctors around the world. I try to give my
      time to studies if possible for those researching and aiming to help those
      of us who have these conditions.

      I have given talks in schools and done career days to try and encourage
      more females into STEM via InspiringTheFuture. I try to empower them to
      code online at home if possible and explore the idea of becoming a
      developer. I am a member of the Women's Equality Party because I believe
      in equality for women forwarding equality for all as a first step. I like
      to read blogs and books by designers and developers who work in the
      accessibility and React community. I occasionally attend conferences and
      would like to think about delivering more talks one day, but this can be
      harder with health problems. Whilst I cannot dedicate as much time as I’d
      like to to tech outside of work, I do generally try to do a little here
      and there (health permitting!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Away from the tech work I play on my Nintendo Switch, watch pro wrestling
      (I used to train as a wrestler back in the day before health played into
      that). I’m a bit of a coffee snob, but I promise you if you ask why I will
      come across as a nerd and probably give you a lecture in “science of
      coffee” and how support small local roasters is far better than pouring
      your money into Starbucks (but ultimately you do you!). There’s a 1000
      other creative projects I want to start and things I want to learn, but my
      limitations are apparent and I learnt to not push myself. But if I’m on a
      new thing, you’ll hear about it super enthusiastically, trust me! You can
      find recommendations and endorsements on my LinkedIn page, or if you’d
      like to discuss my full CV please get in touch.

      I tweet as @annekasillitoe if you want to see the see where I’m at. It’s
      not massively tech heavy these days, as I find my twitter has become an
      invaluable source in keeping me connected in the patient community of my
      conditions, but I’m still there reading stuff from those I follow, whether
      health, tech related, wrestling, politics, coffee or cute puppers!
