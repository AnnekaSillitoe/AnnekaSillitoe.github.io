I worked\n      as a music journalist before making the career change to the other side\n      and working in PR and marketing within the music industry. I decided after\n      doing this for almost 7 years that I wanted more from my career and I had\n      just started learning to code. Since then I've spent the last 5 years\n      working as a web developer, with a focus on front end development and\n      accessibility.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I've spoken at meetups on accessibility in web development and given\n      talks, and attended careers days and seminars in schools to try and\n      encourage females into STEM careers (specifically working as a web\n      developer because it's what I know).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At present I live in Surrey in the UK, where I spend time gaming, watching\n      wrestling, working as a patient advocate for my own health conditions,\n      watching cartoons and practicing my voice acting skills, drinking\n      speciaility coffee and educating myself on the science behind a good cup.\n      If you'd like to speak to me about any of this or anything else, please\n      say <a href=\"mailto:annekasillitoe@gmail.com?Subject=Hello\">hello!</a>\n    </p>\n  </section>\n);\n\nexport default About;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport About from \"./About\";\n\nconst Home = () => <About />;\n\nexport default Home;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nconst WhatNext = () => (\n  <section>\n    <h2>What next?</h2>\n    <p>\n      As I start to think about what I want to achieve in my career and what I'd\n      be looking for in my next role, I start to truly understand where I want\n      to see myself in the next 5 years. Whether that holds a traditional\n      company role or not I'll ultimately unsure, but what I would like to\n      personally achieve is becoming more and more clear.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I would be looking for the opportunity to mentor and give back. Early in\n      my career my values and beliefs were ultimately shaped by who I got to\n      work with the messages that they passed on to me. Luckily I've been\n      incredibly supported early into my career by fantastic senior developers\n      who always told me to demand my worth and continue to push for the things\n      I was most passionate about. Those things are accessibility and equality.\n      They fall hand in hand with the user-experience and writing front end\n      code. I want the opportunity to guide a junior through the turbulant time\n      of a new career and help them to start a really fulfiling career in tech.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I love learning. I love watching videos and trying out bits of code and\n      digging around on MDN for answers. I love reading about W3C process and\n      the CSS working groups changes and how the web continues to be improved by\n      these areas of education and transforming the web for all. I have found\n      fantastic male and female role models in areas of accessibilty, front end\n      code, design, react, education and equality. And I feel very blessed to\n      have an extensive list I can reach to when I want the answers to a\n      question. But I want to join that list. I want to start teching and\n      creating content for other developers to learn and reference. I want to be\n      a positive female voice proving that women can achieve in tech.

But then my partner took up coding and was\n      teaching himself around his day job and well, he doesn’t have a degree in\n      computing so that myth went out the window. But he is pretty clever, so\n      this is still a super mastermind genius job right?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Then I started to write code myself. At the time I was still working as a\n      freelance journalist and PR/marketing type and being grossly underpaid for\n      the sheer hours and effort I was putting it. But the thing that really\n      made me look to change careers was how much more fun writing code was\n      compared to my day/night/all the time job. I realised I was no longer\n      having fun for the amount of work I was doing and that I found I wanted to\n      go home at night instead of to a gig to interview an artist and I wanted\n      to sit and write a bunch of code and build another fun thing cause I could\n      do that! (badly and slowly… but stuff was happening!)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      So I decided to take the plunge and change careers. I had started out\n      learning HTML and CSS and JS through all the usual online\n      haunts, Codecademy, Khan Academy (learning some more maths here too to\n      play with css animation some) & freecodecamp. Once I had exhausted these\n      resources, I paid for a CodeSchoolsubscription and started on there, doing\n      the same things but in the most fun environment for learning I’ve still\n      ever experienced in my career. (RIP CodeSchool! Those songs will stay with\n      me forever!)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But whilst moving through my learning, a local print shop wanted a new\n      developer to start building their e-commerce site for them. It was\n      templated already, it just needed someone with the knowledge (or some!) to\n      go in and build out the pages for them. Hook their payment system up to\n      SagePay and deliver the goods. I got the job. My first paid for freelance\n      tech role (which looking back they paid criminally low for and no wonder\n      they loved me!). But I didn’t care, I was being paid to spend my day\n      working on a website that people would see and use.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It was here I did my first pair programming, via a phone with a guy who\n      worked at another branch of the print design store and he spoke about\n      things I’d never heard of. Things my partner had knowledge of since his\n      bootcamp and first role. The back end! This mysterious world that I was\n      interacting with via his help… but without any knowledge of. I should\n      learn this… I might like this.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      So I applied to a bootcamp. I had no money and no job at this time, other\n      than the criminally low freelance work I was doing here and there. I\n      couldn’t afford a big bootcamp, but I wanted to learn more. I was lucky. I\n      got accepted onto a bootcamp and off I went for 16 weeks to learn\n      everything from front end to back end, API’s to testing, frameworks and\n      more. The very last week of that bootcamp I got introduced to React and I\n      fell in love!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I did a bit more freelance work for charities via the bootcamp, but I\n      wanted to find a permanent role now. I wanted a solid wage, (I had been\n      surviving on the reminants of my student loan that I had saved), and to\n      learn more from people who had been doing this much longer than I. So I\n      sort out my first role. I was the only female, the first female on the dev\n      team. Little did I know this experience would play into my work choices\n      years later. I didn’t care though, I was being paid to write code. But\n      that code wasn’t React. That code was Angular 2 and I didn’t fall in love\n      the same way. The songs on CodeSchool were amazing… the framework was\n      fine… but it wasn’t like React. I continued to programme in React at home.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The 6 month mark was rolling around on my first role and the company\n      started to hit financial issues. Welcome to startup life! I would need to\n      hunt for a new job. But that’s ok, I’d make sure this one was in React.\n    </p>\n  </>\n);\n\nexport default StartingOut;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nconst FirstJob = () => (\n  <>\n    <h3>My first job of choice</h3>\n    <p>\n      I’d say up until this point I jumped at the first opportunity I saw.

This time, whilst the pressure was on… I could\n      be a bit more fussy. I understood how the tech world worked a little\n      better and I knew whilst I couldn’t ask for the world, or rightfully\n      demand it… I could look more towards sectors that interested me:\n      TechForGood/NotForProfits, Science, Healthcare, Education.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It was the first one where I ended up. A company doing social good across\n      the world on a range of topics, with a tiny little tech team (5 of us once\n      I joined - I was once again the only female) building digital products for\n      local authorities mostly. I felt good with the work I was doing. I had a\n      great team around me, albeit little. A product manager with a wealth of\n      experience and enthusiasm. A data scientist who had started his career as\n      a developer before getting the necessary degrees and one who was super\n      inquisitive and engaging! A CTO with a great sense of humour and who was\n      willing to pair and teach at a moment’s notice. And a senior front end who\n      had seen it all, done it all and sat me down over a cocktail one evening\n      and said, “always demand what you are worth! If we all do that, we all get\n      paid better and more equally! It doesn’t matter that you’re a woman,\n      you’re incredibly good at this”. I cherish that conversation even still.\n      I’ve always tried to fight mine and others corner since, because he was\n      right! I spent my time building in React… the latest version. Upgrading to\n      the latest version when it was stable. I got to explore Redux and the\n      newest versions as they were released. Testing with Jest and Enzyme. An\n      introduction to tools like Prettier and Capybara. Browserstack, AWS. The\n      list goes on.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The team got bigger and changed over my time there, but despite its small\n      nature we got the opportunity to explore tools and play around. It was\n      really great! I got to learn accessibility and started to explore what\n      this meant and how much of the web seemed to ignore this very important\n      legal requirement. And I got to teach my peers about it and make sure they\n      used it. But I was reaching the point in my career where I wanted to do\n      more and sadly with such a small team this wasn’t going to provide me with\n      the things I needed next.\n    </p>\n    <p> So I made the decision to leave.</p>\n  </>\n);\n\nexport default FirstJob;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nconst Heatlh = () => (\n  <>\n    <h2>Health and a new role</h2>\n    <p>\n      Just as I was changing roles or deciding on changing roles I got really\n      sick. Sicker than I’d ever been before and along the long arduous journey\n      to a diagnosis and treatment I discovered I had a heritable disorder of\n      connective tissue. Which basically means I inherited some rubbish genes\n      and my body wouldn’t ever quite be right again.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In fact it had never been right and I hadn’t ever truly noticed the signs.\n      But it explained a lot to me. I used to like going to gigs and being out\n      late, because I didn’t like mornings. I’m still not a morning person. My\n      condition often stops me from achieving quality sleep (despite getting at\n      least 8 hours a night), so I wake up tired and it’s a struggle to get\n      ready and out the house to an office daily. But since getting sick I now\n      have to eat a low carb diet… my body cannot cope with anything else. My\n      autonomic nervous system doesn’t function right, carbs make everything bad\n      - I get tremors and my ears ring constantly and my digestion gets really\n      bad and as a result of all these things, I get weirdly anxious (it’s all\n      to do with hormones and the nervous system and I could talk for hours on\n      this… but this isn’t the place for that!). But along with now being\n      classed as disabled, it had given me a new sense of purpose and knowledge\n      and insight. One I had only ever seen glimpses of before, or one I just\n      didn’t know about!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It’s why I want to work remotely and why I want to work for a company that\n      is remote first. You might not know your employees full situation and they\n      shouldn’t have to disclose it to you just to get given the chance to have\n      a nicer life, an easier life. Working from home makes me SO much more\n      productive. I can sleep in 2 hours later, I can get breakfast and eat it\n      whilst I start work checking my emails and getting prepared for the day. I\n      can eat lunch because I didn’t have to stress about preparing to bring to\n      the office my stupid dietary needs that aren’t easy to get from a\n      supermarket or a local corner shop. These are just some of the reasons I\n      want to work for a remote-first company personally, but everyone should be\n      given that opportunity equally, because they might have reasons far\n      different from mine and equally as justified, including just ‘I prefer\n      it!’.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Anyway, back to the story. I was lucky with my new company I had been\n      hugely supported through all this and I eventually made a phased return to\n      work (it’s an invisible illness. I am disabled… but I am still capable\n      with the right support!), before eventually returning full time. I was now\n      working at FutureLearn. I was a full stack developer working in React and\n      Ruby and I was changing people’s lives through ‘transforming access to\n      education’. The role provided training formally (something I’d never had\n      before). The company were really good at pair programming, learning\n      through others and it cared A LOT about accessibility. One of the main\n      reasons I had taken the role. I wanted to give back, but teaching others\n      now I’d got this far in to my career, mentoring. Whilst I would get to\n      teach and share my knowledge through pair programming, sadly we have never\n      hired juniors during my time at FutureLearn and I still await an\n      opportunity to help guide others through the beginnings fo their career.\n      But the team is 50% women (as of very recently) and it’s not a thing I\n      want to compromise on again in future roles. I understand most company out\n      there won’t have these numbers, but I want to hear what they’re doing to\n      reach these numbers and how much of that percentage will be disabled,\n      identify with a different gender other than ‘male’ or ‘female’, will not\n      be white or heterosexual. I want to know that my future employers when\n      they say they are committed to diversity, they mean it. They aren’t just\n      ticking a box by hiring into one of those areas, but that they aim to be\n      as diverse as possible and will build their products with the widest\n      possible input. If you’re a tech bros company, why are you? What are you\n      doing about fixing that and why should I be the only female on your team\n      again? And how long until I’m not? It’s something I am incredibly\n      passionate about. I’ve been very lucky to work for a company who has\n      improved the gender balance of the tech team, but are still lacking other\n      areas and will hold their hands up to that. It’s a fantastic place to work\n      culturally.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A few examples of things I’ve learned and achieved since being at\n      FutureLearn:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Pairing/mobbing - I had paired previously, but it’s pairing first here\n        to share the knowledge and I have loved every single second of that as I\n        am constantly learning from other fantastic developers of all levels. I\n        also did my first ever mobbing here and I loved every single second of\n        that too. It taught me some of the most important things I could take\n        away with me.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Atomic commits and telling the story through your commit history. Commit\n        messages are LONG at FL. And every developer hates it when they first\n        join and within a week they love it because you always know why a change\n        was made in the code base by a person. You are given context and\n        reasons, options and why this line of code exists. It’s all there for\n        you and when you’re looking at something 5 years old, that’s HUGELY\n        useful (especially if people have moved on since then)\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        A/B testing - I’d never done this before. I’d always wanted to. I doubt\n        I’ll use the platform we did ever again, but to understand statistical\n        significance much more and why companies will want to A/B test has been\n        educational\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        TAX! - No seriously… I spent months learning about how tax works and how\n        foreign tax can work and then how it needed to work for us and why and\n        how.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Working on a monolith means I’ve learned to appreciate life with SPA’s,\n        RESTful APIs and micro services a lot more. They’re a luxury and I won’t\n        ever take them for granted again.{\" \"}\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Testing - I did more TDD here than ever before and whilst I’m still not\n        GREAT at it… I’m certainly better at it. I also understand why and how\n        to better test everything more than I did before I started.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>So why leave? Why start looking? </p>\n    <p>\n      From a career perspective, the time has come to move on. There’s things I\n      want to do that I can’t where I currently am. Things I want to achieve. I\n      want to move back into the front end and really become a MASTER of the\n      front end. I want to learn even more React, understand things better, test\n      more and set up projects and explore tools in ways I’ve not done for a\n      long time. With my new found knowledge, I think this could be an amazing\n      time for my growth and my career.
